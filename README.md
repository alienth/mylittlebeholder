## Modify GM execution of player actions/spells to be more robust.

    If a GM executes a player action or spell, we read the spell chat message
    to determine what player actually cast it, so that we can use the spell
    slots appropriately.

    If the charsheet could let the GM choose who executed the action/spell,
    then we could check playerid rather than pulling the name out of the chat
    message.

## Memoize getPlayerCharacters

## Use processInlineRolls on rechargeSpells for Warlock & Sorc Points

## Implement rechargeSpells

## Implement rechargeHP

## Add Reckless Attack status check
